<h2>RC Car Bombs</h2>
Bombs are taped to remote-controlled cars, which are dropped from  a vehicle and then piloted to impact.
When attacking with this dropped weapon, place a RC Car (use a tiny car miniature, no larger than 20mm square) so that it is within Short Range of the attacking vehicle, and facing in any direction.
This placement triggers a Collision Windows. The RC Car counts as a lightweight vehicle in current Gear 3 with 1 Hull Point, 1 Crew and 0 Handling.
This tiny car can make shooting attacks but cannot change Gear. Although controlled by the player that dropped it, the RC Car does not count as part of the player's team, and so cannot be used for the purposes of scenario rules, Audience Votes, or Perks.
If the RC Car is involved in a Collision, it suffers one damage before the Collision is resolved. When the RC Car would be Wrecked, it instead explodes. When the RC Car explodes, it rolls 4D6 attack dice, as if it were a middleweight vehicle.
If the RC Car wipes out, it suffers one damage before the Wipeout is resolved.
